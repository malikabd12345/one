<h2>CAPTAIN:SHANKS</h2>
</center>
<h4>The Red Hair Pirates are one of the most prominent pirate crews in the manga and anime series One Piece.  They're led by their chief "Red Hair" Shanks, who is one of the strongest pirates in the series, one of the four to hold the title of Yonko, the four pirate Emperors who rules the New World.  They're the least known of all of the Yonko crews so far, but Shanks himself is a close friend and role model for the protagonist of the series, Monkey D. Luffy, which also means that their crew could be considered an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates, albeit loosely and they haven't teamed up as of yet.  Their ship is called the Red Force.  </h4>
    <h4>It's known that the chief, Shanks, was one a big rival of Dracule Mihawk, the current greatest swordsman in the world.  The two of them fought many times, and it's been speculated by fans that this means that Shanks was the previous greatest swordsman in the world, but so far this has yet to be confirmed or denied.</h4>
<h4>Other known members consists of the first mate Ben Beckman, eight Senior Officers who are Yasopp, Lucky Roo, Limejuice, Bonk Punch, Monster, Building Snake, Hongo, and Gab, and one of the most recent recruits Rockstar, who is the one that Shanks sent to Whitebeard to try and procure a meeting.

<h2>CAPTAIN:KAIDO</h2>
</center>
<h4>The Beasts Pirates[2] are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew led by their governor-general, Kaidou, formerly one of the Four Emperors. They were based in Wano Country, specifically headquartered on Onigashima.[3][4]
</h4>
<h4>For the past 26 years, the Beast Pirates consolidated their power in Wano, which they occupied through an alliance with the country's shogun, Kurozumi Orochi.[3][5] Within the past four years, the crew partnered with Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown to create artificial Zoan Devil Fruits called SMILE Fruits, leading to the crew having over 500 users with Devil Fruit powers. After the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance captured Caesar, destroyed the SMILE Factory and defeated Doflamingo, Kaidou turned to a new alliance with the Big Mom Pirates. The two Emperors' alliance planned to conquer the world by obtaining the Ancient Weapons and the One Piece.[6] Part of this plan is Kaidou's "New Onigashima Project", which sought to replace Orochi as shogun with Yamato during the latest Fire Festival.[7] This scheme ultimately failed, as during the Raid on Onigashima, all their top officers, alongside his fellow Emperor Big Mom, were defeated one after another by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance and Kaidou himself was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates.[8] After the battle, Kaidou was sent flying down into an underground magma chamber and was caught in a massive volcanic explosion,[9] while the fates of the remaining members are unclear.
    </h4>
<h4>As a result, Kaidou was no longer considered as one of the Four Emperors following the announcement of his defeat, leaving the overall status of the Beasts Pirates unknown.

<h2>CAPTAIN:Charlotte Linlin</h2>
</center>
<h4>The Big Mom Pirates[1] are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew led by their captain, Charlotte Linlin, better known as "Big Mom", formerly one of the Four Emperors. They are in control of the powerful nation of Totto Land, with their captain ruling it as its queen and their base of operations being Whole Cake Island, the country's main island. The captain agreed to an alliance with the Beasts Pirates for plans to take over the world.[2] However, the captain was defeated during the Raid on Onigashima by two members of the Worst Generation,[3] and she was subsequently stripped of her position as an Emperor, leaving the crew's status unknown.
    </h4>
<h4>Due to their actions and role, they are the main antagonists of the Whole Cake Island Arc and one of the central antagonist groups of the Whole Cake Island Saga.

<h1>BLACK BEARD PIRATES</h1>

<h2>CAPTAIN:Marshall D. Teach</h2>
</center>
<h4>Marshall D. Teach,[16] most commonly referred to by his epithet "Blackbeard",[2] is the captain-turned-admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates,[8] and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World.[3] He is also the only known person in history to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits,[17] as well as being part of a special bloodline, which is only known to a small number of individuals, including his own crew and the Five Elders.[18]
    </h4>
<h4>Teach started out his pirate career as an apprentice of the Whitebeard Pirates, then later became a member of the crew's 2nd Division.[6] However, he murdered Thatch, the 4th Division Commander, in order to steal the Yami Yami no Mi, a rare darkness-based Logia Devil Fruit with the power to nullify the Devil Fruit abilities of others.[7] He then fled from Whitebeard's crew and, after defeating the infamous 2nd Division Commander Portgas D. Ace and handing him over to the Marines,[4] was awarded a position among the Seven Warlords of the Sea. He only held the position briefly, though, using it to infiltrate the great underwater prison Impel Down and escaping with multiple infamous Level 6 prisoners recruited into his crew. Upon arriving at the Summit War of Marineford,[5] he resigned from his position and murdered Whitebeard, mysteriously stealing his quake-generating power. This, along with his victory in the Payback War[19] and conquest of the majority of Whitebeard's territories during the timeskip, resulted in his acknowledgement as one of the Four Emperors, as well as him being considered a part of the "Worst Generation" along with the eleven Supernovas.[20] After the Rocky Port Incident, he turned the island of Hachinosu into his base of operations with the ambition of having it officially accepted into the World Government as the Blackbeard Kingdom.[21][22]
    </h4>
<h4>Teach initially had no bounty;[4] however, after resigning from the Seven Warlords, recruiting several dangerous criminals to his crew from Impel Down, and becoming one of the Four Emperors, he received a bounty of Beli2,247,600,000.[15] Following the downfalls of Kaidou and Big Mom during the Wano Country Arc, his bounty was increased to Beli3,996,000,000 for unknown reasons.[14]
    </h4>
<h4>Due to his actions throughout the series, namely his key role in the deaths of Portgas D. Ace and Whitebeard, Teach consistently serves as one of the primary antagonists of the entire series. During the series' first half, he is an unseen minor antagonist in the Drum Island Arc, a minor antagonist in the Jaya Arc, the secondary antagonist of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, and one of the main antagonists of the Summit War Saga (specifically, the secondary antagonist of the Impel Down Arc and one of the three primary antagonists in the Marineford Arc). During the series' second half, he is a minor antagonist in the Dressrosa Arc, a supporting antagonist in the Egghead Arc and serves as one of the overarching main antagonists in the Final Saga.

<h2>CAPTAIN:MONKEY D.LUFFY</h2>
</CENTER>
<h4>The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew, or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue. They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.
    </h4>
<h4>The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom.[13] The crew sailed on the Going Merry,[14] their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship, which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.[15]
    </h4>
<h4>Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other.[16] They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four Emperors.[17]
